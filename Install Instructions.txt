3. I know you don't actually exist, but you'll need to tweak the file paths in the "16_CStrifeWinMugen.def". 
Not like I need to explain that though, if you are using Linux chances are you already knew you'd need to do that before hand!

3.Upgrade to a newer version Mugen.


4. Make sure you have "16_EnSND.snd" or "16_JpSND.snd" included in this characters audio folder. They are both available for seperate download on my site (see ReadMe.html)
